/*
We want to be able to create lists of entities that have been edited recently.

"Entity" is the core table and model that edited on LittleSis. Many actions only
change models other than an entity directly are still considered an edit to that entity.
For instance, if a user adds a tag to an entity, it doesn't change the Entity table but
instead adds a new row to `tagging`. We want that change and other to be represented
as an "edited entity".

One additional complication: edits to relationships are considered to be an edit of two
different entities at the same time. Those rows need to into split into two different "edits."

This function returns a JSON array contains objects with the following fields:

entity_id     ID of the entited entity
created_at    when the edit occured
user_id       ID of the user who edited the entity
version_id    Primary ID of the version table
item_type     The model that was edited. i.e. Person, Relationship, etc.
item_id       Id of the model that was edited.

The result set will contain duplicates. Futher processing of this data is handled by ruby.
